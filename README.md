# Swift Coding Challenges
Swift Coding Challenges from the book of HSW by Paul Hudson

## Challenge #1 - Are the letters unique? 
Write a function that accepts a String as its only parameter, and returns true if the string has only unique letters, taking letter case into account. 

#### Test Cases
> challenge1(input: "No duplicates") // Should return true

> challenge1(input: "AaBbCc") // Should return true

> challenge1(input: "Hello, World") // Should return false - there are more than 1 'l'

## Challenge #2 - Is a string a palindrome? 

## Challenge #3 - Do two strings contain the same characters? 

## Challenge #4 - Does one string contain another?
